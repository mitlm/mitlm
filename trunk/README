=============================
MIT Language Modeling Toolkit
=============================

The MIT Language Modeling (MITLM) toolkit is a set of tools designed
for the efficient estimation of statistical n-gram language models
involving iterative parameter estimation.  It achieves much of its
efficiency through the use of a compact vector representation of
n-grams.  Details of the data structure and associated algorithms can
be found in the following paper.

  * Bo-June (Paul) Hsu and James Glass. Iterative Language Model
    Estimation: Efficient Data Structure & Algorithms.  In
    Proc. Interspeech, 2008.

Currently, MITLM supports the following features:

  * Smoothing: Modified Kneser-Ney, Kneser-Ney, maximum likelihood
  * Interpolation: Linear interpolation, count merging, generalized
    linear interpolation
  * Evaluation: Perplexity
  * File formats: ARPA, binary, gzip, bz2

MITLM is available for download under the MIT License. It has been
built and tested on 32-bit and 64-bit Intel CPUs running Debian Linux
7.0. It currently requires the following:

  * ANSI C++/Fortran compiler (GCC 4.7.1+)

The design and implementation of this toolkit benefited significantly
from the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit by Andreas Stolcke.

The vector library is partially derived from the Flexible Library for
Efficient Numerical Solutions by Michael Lehn.
